    [x] Detect doctests in python files.
    [x] Only show button when doctests are present.

[ ] More commands
    [ ] Command to switch between button themes
    [ ] Command to enable/disable doctestbtn
    [ ] Command to enable/disable background doctesting?
    [ ] (Probably not) Command to 'lint' using doctest

[ ] More Settings
    [ ] Add command structure setting.
        - Would allow you to change the structure of the command sent during doctest execution
    [ ] Setting for enabling/disabling doctestbtn
    [ ] Setting for enabling/disabling background doctesting?
    [ ] Setting to run background testing on save/type?

[ ] Status Bar Items

        [ ] maybe route to settings?
    [ ] Pass/fail Counter
        - redirect to the first failed doctest?
    [ ] Possible options: Pass/fail doctests, pass/fail modules, mix
        - could even have a formattable setting like discord extension
