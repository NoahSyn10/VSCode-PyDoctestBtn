# DoctestBtn README

DoctestBtn is a simple VSCode extension that aims to replicate the ease of use of the 'run button' included in Microsoft's [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and apply it to running Python [doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

## Features

### The Doctest Button

* The doctest button mimics the functionality of the Python extension's run button and uses it to run doctests.
* When clicked:
  * The active document is saved.
  * Focus is brought to the terminal (*a terminal is created if necessary*).
  * Your preferred Python path is used to doctest the active document.

### Button Icon Options

* There are three options for the style of the doctest button:
  * 'Plain'
  * 'Fancy'
  * 'Xtra Fancy'
    ##### *Named for their alphabetical order.

* The preferred icon can be chosen using two boolean configurations in user settings.
  * Turning on 'Xtra Fancy' overrides 'Fancy' regardless of its state.

### `execDoctest` Command

* Can be found in command pallate under "Execute Python File in Terminal" when a .py file is in focus.
  * Saves active document.
  * Focus is brought to the terminal (*a terminal is created if necessary*).
  * Your preferred Python and Doctest paths are used to doctest the active document.

## To Do

* [ ] Implement Doctest Detection.
  * Detect doctests in python files.
  * Only show button when doctests are present.
  * Show number of tests found in status bar.
    * Maybe show tests passed/failed?
* [ ] Add command structure setting.
  * Would allow you to change the structure of the command sent during doctest execution
